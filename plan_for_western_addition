        - wind from west to east
        - seems like good sun. some spots very shaded due to dense canopy of a few trees
      - what are some pests (gopher? cape ivy? blackberry?)
        - trash
        - leaf litter on sidewalk from trees
        - spotted hemlock, solanum, some sort of fibrous grass

    - clean up first.
      - get all trash
      - identify trash spots and eliminate them
      - identify dead things and eliminate them
      - identify hideyholes and eliminate them
      - identify ugly things that bother me and eliminate them
    - redefine all paths using a spade and line trimmer and rake
    - blow paths

    - understand irrigation
      - make a map
      - uncover all valve boxes
      - look at controller
      - do audit to see if anything is broken


DO NOT MAKE ANY PLANS UNTIL ALL EDGES ARE DEFINED AND ALL DEAD THINGS ARE CUT DOWN
DO. NOT. MAKE. NEW. PLANS.

DO establish a staging area for plants if possible
DO establish a dumping area for herbaceous greenwaste if possible
DO choose an experimental area where conditions are representative of the park / plants can be tested or propagated there
