status update
it has been one month at jefferson. i have spent most of this month just trying to get things in order and mitigate grossness in the park. the current gross spots are:
- the steps under the cedar at eddy and gough
- under the cypress at turk crosswalk
- the bench at the entrance of eddy and laguna
- the bench under the pittosporum on the west side
- actually both benches under pittosporums (east side also)
- the pittosporum on west side
- both east and west side of the asbestos shed

i have edged the paths to an acceptable standard.
i have blown the sidewalks and steps a few times, at least enough that there are no piles of debris sitting in any spots.
i have started to cut back viburnum shrubs post-flowering. there are many that i have not gotten to yet.

secret projects that i have started:
- juncus rain drain: there was an attempt to plant a rain-garden type thing at the drain near eddy and laguna / where the turf is very shady and muddy. this attempt was a failure because the juncus had mostly died except two large clumps, which were covered by various weeds.
i grubbed out the weeds, dug out the juncus, graded the area around the drain so that it would be a horseshoe-shaped trench around the drain, divided the juncus, replanted the juncus, and mulched on top. i also added a few pieces of Salvia spathecea that was growing along turk planter bed, and a few bits of Achillea millefolium that i took from eddy and laguna corner.

- artemisia circle: at the eddy entrance there is a circle planter bed with stone border that is 99% artemisia 1% grevillea that was growing over the stone border and looks super boring and ugly and the soil level is so high that it is mounded over and also has ehrharta in it.
i have begun to lower the soil level by cutting back artemisia, removing soil by the shovelful (which i then use to fill dogdig holes) to 2-3inches below the stone border, then grading and replanting pieces of artemisia as well as yarrow that i found from around the park.

summary:
there is a lot of work to do just in terms of making this look ... presentable. the bright side is that things do seem to be growing quite well; only a few things are suffering, but they will soon die and i will remove them. however this means there is a lot to cut back or replant. the nice part of this is there is a lot of plant material to go around.
currently every part of this park is uniform and uninteresting. i do not think there is a way to carve out a whole new area. all new developments must be gradual.

personal eyesore spots:
- eddy and laguna is a bare corner that currently has scrophularia, one patch of eschscholzia, and a bit of yarrow that is starting to spread (yay). it also has the bench that collects litter. i will figure out a way to regrade this and make it nice. sometimes making things nice discourages trash.
- volcano east steps: trash collector, plus rampant ehrharta, and spillover of soil/mulch level. can be pushed back to form berms around existing plants, plus i can weed this area while i do earthworks.
